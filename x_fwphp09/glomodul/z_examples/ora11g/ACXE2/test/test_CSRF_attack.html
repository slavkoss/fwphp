hack.html: Show issues with C S R F 
another site can take advantage of you being logged in 
and cause you to submit data or do some other privileged operation.

1. Run AnyCo application and login as Administrator. 
2. In new browser tab or window, open  U R L :
      http://dev:8083/t_oci8/ACXE2/test_csrf_attack.html
3. Click Win button. This calls the AnyCo application and causes the bogus 
equipment name SPAM to be inserted into the equipment list of employee 100 
(which is Steven King).
------------------- 
4. edit B6_cre.php and enable csrf protection by removing the comments for 
the check in printcontent().
5. form in B6_cre.php includes a generated Cross-Site Request Forgery token as 
a hidden field. Value is also stored in user session. csrf check in 
printcontent() will verify that token in submitted form matches PHPs stored 
session value.
------------------
6. do 2., 3. again
7. This time csrf protection in printcontent() doesnt find a csrf token in the 
submitted form and redirects to the login page, index.php, which logs out. 
8. Log back in again to the AnyCo application and check that Steven King's equipment
   list is unchanged, with no second entry for SPAM. 
   For hack.html to be successful it would have to know the value of the csrftoken 
   field that gets stored in the PHP session when the B6_cre.php generates 
   real entry form.
csrf protection is just one of many kinds of security restrictions that web app 
should enforce. You should do a thorough security evaluation of any code you deploy 
on the web.
Many of the popular PHP frameworks provide assistance to reduce the amount of 
effort required in producing a secure application. For example they may provide a 
more secure implementation of csrf token generation than the one in the AnyCo 
Session class.
