Possibilities of MVC pattern are endless. For example different layers can be implemented in different languages or distributed on different machines.
AJAX applications can implement V layer directly in Javascript in the browser, invoking JSON services. The controller can be partially implemented on client, partially on server

    advantages of Model View Controller pattern:

    the Model and View are separated, making the application more flexible.
    the Model and view can be changed separately, or replaced. For example a web application can be transformed in a smart client application just by writing a new View module, or an application can use web services in the backend instead of a database, just replacing the model module.
    each module can be tested and debugged separately.
