## Description

This *PHP Blog System* 
1. has an MVC pattern,     
2. uses Traits (PHP 5.4),    
3. Namespace (PHP 5.3),       
4. Singleton pattern,    
5. PDO (PHP 5.1)      
6. and the new PHP Password Hashing feature (PHP 5.5).

The project was a *PHP Challenge Project* I have done.


## Why this MVC Blog System can be very Useful for You?

If you need to code a SIMPLE WEBSITE under a PROFESSIONAL AND VERY NICE/CLEAN CODE (as I really enjoy doing), this script will be very useful in order to *start on good basis* and *save time and money*.

However, if you need to BUILD A BLOG SYSTEM, again this project can be used as a *FRAMEWORK* TO START your project easily under a *GOOD DEVELOPMENT PATTERN* and *GOOD DEVELOPMENT PRACTICE* AND ORGANIZATION.


## Requirements that were Requested for the Project

### Requirements

* The project should be written in object-oriented PHP targeting version 5.5 or higher
* It should be all self-written, no existing frameworks or libraries
* It should have good security (e.g., hashed passwords, protect against SQL injection, shouldn't have any error when we try to change URL query strings or to hack it, etc)
* Should use a MySQL database to store admin account and article data

### Specification

*Build a simple blog with the following functionalities*

#### The Frontend

* List of blog articles showing the **title**, **body** truncated to 100 characters, and **date**. It should show only the latest 5 articles
