  <p>Remember, when flex basis is 0 , the available space of the container 
   (not just the extra space) is distributed proportionally based on the 
   growth factors present. This is not what we want in this case either. We 
   want the longer content to take up more space than the shorter content. 
  </p>
  <p>In 
   the case of flex-basis: auto; , the extra space is distributed 
   proportionally based on the flex growth factors.<br>With all the links set 
   to flex: auto; , the space not consumed by actual content is divided 
   equally among the links. The links all have the same growth and shrink 
   factors. The links will look like they all have equal left and right 
   padding, with the &quot;padding&quot; changing dynamically based on the available 
   space.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
