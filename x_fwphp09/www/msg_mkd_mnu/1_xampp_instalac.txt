Multiple websites or web applications running on the same physical server, and access each using a CUSTOM DOMAIN NAME eg "dev1". This is known as virtual hosting, and each virtual host can be mapped to a different subdirectory of the server.

This feature is especially useful in development scenarios, as it allows developers to isolate and access different applications using unique domain names. For example, the domains http://app01.localhost and http://app02.localhost could point to two separate applications on the same server. Or, you could create separate domains, such as http://client1/, http://client2/ and so on, for multiple client websites hosted on the same server.

Virtual hosts created in this manner will not be accessible from other systems, unless those systems are separately configured to associate the custom domain used by the virtual host with the IP address of the XAMPP server. This guide walks you through the process of setting up a new virtual host with XAMPP, by creating and configuring an example host named wordpress.localhost for a WordPress installation. It assumes that you have an existing WordPress installation at C:\xampp\apps\wordpress\htdocs\ and accessible via the URL http://localhost/wordpress. 
You can install WordPress with just a few clicks using the Bitnami WordPress Module for XAMPP :
https://bitnami.com/stack/xampp#wordpress 

1. httpd-vhosts.conf file in the apache\conf\extra\
===================================================

2. Replace the contents of this file with the following directives (if 8083 instead 80 in httpd.conf
and in xampp-control.exe called as admin from SyMenu -> button "Config" -> button "Service and port settings"):

#DEFAULT OR FALLBACK VIRTUAL HOST, which is used for all requests that are not matched by subsequent blocks :
<VirtualHost *:8083>
       DocumentRoot "J:/xampp/htdocs/"
       ServerName localhost
</VirtualHost>
#
#subsequent blocks :
#VIRTUAL HOST NAMED DEV1 (or wordpress.localhost)
<VirtualHost *:8083>
    #directory to be used when serving requests for this virtual host :
       #DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/apps/wordpress/htdocs"
       DocumentRoot "J:/awww/www"
    #custom domain name for the virtual host
    #f you want to use SSL with your custom domain name, add a new virt. host block for port 443
    #If you plan to have a large number of virtual hosts with very similar configuration, consider using wildcard-based subdomains with your virtual hosts. 
       #ServerName wordpress.localhost
       ServerName dev1
</VirtualHost>


3. Restart Apache using the XAMPP control panel for your changes to take effect.

4. browsing to dev1 domain http://dev1:8083/fwphp/www/ where http://dev1:8083 means J:/awww/www folder, your browser will show a FAILURE NOTICE, since this domain does not exist in reality. To resolve this, it is necessary to map the custom domain to the local IP address. To do this, OPEN AS ADMIN file C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts and add the following line to it:

127.0.0.1       localhost dev1 https://www.expressvpn.com/
::1             localhost dev1 https://www.expressvpn.com/
or each domain in new 127.0.0.1 line. https://www.expressvpn.com/ is spamer site.

This takes care of mapping dev1 domain name to the local machine, which always has the IP address 127.0.0.1.


5. browsing to dev1 domain http://dev1:8083/fwphp/www/, browser shows FAILURE NOTICE :
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access this resource.
Apache/2.4.51 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1l PHP/8.0.12 Server at dev1 Port 8083

J:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf
===============================
Listen 8083      
ServerName localhost:8083   

...
#### To see http://dev1:8083/fwphp/www/ :
(dev1 is apache virtual host)    
below <Directory "/xampp/htdocs"> put :    
```xml
<Directory "J:/awww/www/">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

Now in J:\xampp\xampp-control.exe :
   1. buttons "Config", "Editor" and "Service and port settings" Apache port 8083
   2. buttons "Start mysql" and "Start Apache"




xampp-portable-windows-x64-8.0.12-0-VS16.7z 
= XAMPP Lite (means "light" as in "light-weight") is a smaller bundle of XAMPP components, which is recommended for quick work using only PHP and MySQL. Some servers or tools such as Mercury Mail and FileZilla FTP are missing in the Lite version.

Installing from ZIP
-------------------
If you choose a root directory "C:\" as target, you must not start "setup_xampp.bat".

Like with the installer version, you can now use the "XAMPP Control Panel" for additional tasks
\xampp\xampp-control.exe.

You can also use some batchfiles to start/stop the servers:

Apache & MySQL start: \xampp\xampp_start.exe
Apache & MySQL stop: \xampp\xampp_stop.exe
Apache start: \xampp\apache_start.bat
Apache stop: \xampp\apache_stop.bat
MySQL start: \xampp\mysql_start.bat
MySQL stop: \xampp\mysql_stop.bat
Mercury Mailserver start: \xampp\mercury_start.bat
Mercury Mailserver stop: \xampp\mercury_stop.bat
FileZilla Server start: \xampp\filezilla_start.bat
FileZilla Server stop: \xampp\filezilla_stop.bat


Each server in XAMPP you can install also as Windows service. You can also install it from the XAMPP Control Panel. In this case it is necessary to run the scripts or the Control Panel with Administrator privileges.

Apache service install: \xampp\apache\apache_installservice.bat

Apache service uninstall: \xampp\apache\apache_uninstallservice.bat

MySQL service install: \xampp\mysql\mysql_installservice.bat

MySQL service uninstall: \xampp\mysql\mysql_uninstallservice.bat

FileZilla service (un)install: \xampp\filezilla_setup.bat

Mercury: No service installation available


The main directory for all WWW documents is \xampp\htdocs. If you put a file "test.html" in this directory, you can access it with the URI "http://localhost/test.html".

What are "Automatic start pages" for the WWW directories?
---------------------------------------------------------
The standard filename for the Apache function "DirectoryIndex" is "index.html" or "index.php". Every time you are just browsing to a folder (e.g. "http://localhost/xampp/"), and Apache can find such a file, Apache is displaying this file instead of a directory listing.


Can I move the XAMPP installation?
----------------------------------
Yes. After moving of the XAMPP directory, you must execute "setup_xampp.bat". The paths in the configuration files will be adjusted with this step.

If you have installed any server as Windows service, you must first remove the Windows service, and after the moving you can install the service again.

WARNING: The configuration files from your own scripts, like PHP applications, are not adjusted. But it's possible to write a "plug-in" for the installer. With such a plug-in, the installer can adjust such files too.


Where are the main XAMPP configuration files?
----------------------------------------------
Almost all settings in XAMPP you can change with configuration files. Just open the file in a textedit and change the setting you want. Only FileZilla and Mercury should be configured with the application config tool.

The main XAMPP configuration files are located as follows:

Apache configuration file: \xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf, \xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-xampp.conf
PHP configuration file: \xampp\php\php.ini
MySQL configuration file: \xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini
FileZilla Server configuration file: \xampp\FileZillaFTP\FileZilla Server.xml
Apache Tomcat configuration file: \xampp\tomcat\conf\server.xml
Apache Tomcat configuration file: \xampp\sendmail\sendmail.ini
Mercury Mail configuration file: \xampp\MercuryMail\MERCURY.INI





Is XAMPP production ready?
--------------------------
XAMPP is not meant for production use but only for development environments. XAMPP is configured to be open as possible to allow the developer anything he/she wants. For development environments, this is great but in a production environment, it could be fatal.

Here a list of missing security in XAMPP:

The MySQL administrator (root) has no password.
The MySQL daemon is accessible via network.
ProFTPD uses the password "lampp" for user "daemon".
The default users of Mercury and FileZilla are known.
All points can be a huge security risk. Especially if XAMPP is accessible via network and people outside your LAN. It can also help to use a firewall or a (NAT) router. In case of a router or firewall, your PC is normally not accessible via network. It is up to you to fix these problems. As a small help there is the "XAMPP Security console".

Please secure XAMPP before publishing anything online. A firewall or an external router are only sufficient for low levels of security. For slightly more security, you can run the "XAMPP Security console" and assign passwords.

If you want have your XAMPP accessible from the internet, you should go to the following URI which can fix some problems:

http://localhost/security/

With the security console you can set a password for the MySQL user "root" and phpMyAdmin. You can also enable a authentication for the XAMPP demopages.

This web based tool does not fix any additional security issues! Especially the FileZilla FTP server and the Mercury mail server you must secure yourself.


Not using the setup script
--------------------------
Not using the setup script, or selecting relative paths in the setup script, is preferred if you are installing XAMPP on a usb drive. Because on each pc such a drive can have an other drive letter. You can switch from absolute to relative paths at any time with the setup script.

Using the installer from our Downloads page is the easiest way to install XAMPP. After the installation is complete, you will find XAMPP under Start | Programs | XAMPP. You can use the XAMPP Control Panel to start/stop all server and also install/uninstall services.

The XAMPP control panel for start/stop Apache, MySQL, FileZilla & Mercury or install these server as services.



How do I uninstall XAMPP?
-------------------------
If you installed XAMPP using the installer version, please use the Uninstaller. The Uninstaller will delete all XAMPP entries from your registry and it will uninstall some installed services included with XAMPP. We highly recommend that you use the Uninstall program for removing XAMPP installations from the Installer version.Please backup all the data you want to keep before uninstalling XAMPP.

If you installed XAMPP using the ZIP and 7zip versions, shut down all XAMPP servers and exit all panels. If you installed any services, uninstall and shut them down too. Now simply delete the entire folder where XAMPP is installed. There are no registry entries and no environment variables to clean up.





Why doesn't the Apache server start on my system?
-------------------------------------------------
This problem can be one of several reasons:

You have started more then one HTTP Server (IIS, Sambar, ZEUS and so on). Only one Server can use port 80. This error message indicate the problem:
(OS 10048)... make_sock: could not bind to adress 0.0.0.0:80
no listening sockets available, shutting down
You have other software, such as the Internet Telephone "Skype" which also blocks the port 80. If the problem is "Skype", you can go in Skype to Actions --> Options --> Connection --> remove the check mark at "use port 80 for an alternate port" and restart Skype. Now it should work.
You have a firewall which blocks the Apache port. Not all firewalls are compatible with Apache, and sometimes deactivating the firewall is not enough and you must deinstall it. This error message indicates a firewall:
(OS 10038)Socket operation on non-socket: make_sock: for address 0.0.0.0:80,
apr_socket_opt_set: (SO_KEEPALIVE)
Also if Apache can start, but your browser can't connect to it it could be due to one of the following:

Some virus scanners can cause this in the same way that firewalls can interfere.
You have XP Professional without service pack 1. You must have at least SP1 for XAMPP.
Tip: If you have problems with used ports, you can try the tool "xampp-portcheck.exe". Maybe it can help.


Why is my CPU load for Apache almost 99%?
-----------------------------------------
There is one of two scenarios at play here. Either your CPU is maxing out, or you can browser connect to the server, but not see anything (the system is trying unsucessfully to load the page). In either case you can find the following message in the Apache log file:

Child: Encountered too many AcceptEx faults accepting client connections.
winnt_mpm: falling back to 'AcceptFilter none'.

The MPM falls back to a safer implementation, but some client requests were not processed correctly. In order to avoid this error, use "AcceptFilter" with accept filter "none" in the "\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-mpm.conf" file.



Why are pictures and style-sheets not displayed?
------------------------------------------------
Sometimes there are problems with displaying pictures and style-sheets. Especially if these files are located on a network drive. In this case you can enable (or add) one if the following lines in the file "\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf":

EnableSendfile off

EnableMMAP off


How do I send email with XAMPP?
-------------------------------
To configure XAMPP to use the included sendmail.exe binary for email delivery, follow these steps:

Edit the XAMPP "php.ini" file. Within this file, find the [mail function] section and replace it with the following directives. Change the XAMPP installation path if needed.
sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"
Edit the XAMPP "sendmail.ini" file. Within this file, find the [sendmail] section and replace it with the following directives:
smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=465
smtp_ssl=auto
error_logfile=error.log
auth_username=your-gmail-username@gmail.com
auth_password=your-gmail-password
Remember to replace the dummy values shown with your actual Gmail address and account password. If you don't plan to use Gmail's SMTP server, replace the SMTP host details with appropriate values for your organization or ISP's SMTP server.

Restart the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.
You can now use PHP's mail() function to send email from your application.
