# Example Guestbook App

This is an example application for the [Jump Start PHP Environment book](http://www.amazon.com/Jump-Start-Environment-Bruno-Skvorc/dp/0994182643).

The application is developed in the last chapter of the book, building on the theory from previous chapters.

## Bonus Content

As promised in the final chapter, the links to all bonus content regarding this app (the explanation of its code and the implementation of advanced features beyond the scope of the book) will be listed here. Coming soon.
