Model and Entity Classes
========================
Model doesnt need any presentation. 

Model represents the DATA AND LOGIC OF AN APPLICATION, 
what many calls BUSINESS LOGIC. Usually, its responsible for:

   -- CRUD app. data - DB operations, but implementing same operations 
      invoking external web services or APIs is not an unusual at all.
   -- encapsulating app. logic. Most common mistakes are to implement 
      application logic operations inside C or V (presentation) layer.

In our example M is represented by 2 classes: 
    Model class 
    and Book class. 

Book class is an ENTITY CLASS. This class SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE VIEW LAYER
and represents format exported by the Model view.
In a good implementation of the MVC pattern 
   -- only entity classes should be exposed by M 
   -- entity classes should not encapsulate any business logic
   -- entity classes solely purpose is to keep data. 
   -- depending on implementation Entity objects can be :
         --- DB tbl
         --- array
         --- xml 
         --- json chunk of data
