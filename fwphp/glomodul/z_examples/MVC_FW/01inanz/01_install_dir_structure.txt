# example uses composer.json and PSR-4 namespace structure. It will help us 
# prevent using many 'require' and 'include' statements in our files

#How it works
#################


The first segment of URL is "controller" name 
and the second one is "method" name in that controller.

    # Logic
    1. User goes to: http://www.yourdomain/
    2. Request gets picked up by index.php
    3. Relevant controller and its method gets triggered
    4. Response is send back
     
    # Example 1
    1. Request: http://www.yourdomain/league
    2. Process: index.php hits "indexMethod" method of League.php controller
    3. Content: Template.php reads "Home\index.html" under "View"
    4. Response send back
     
    # Example 2
    1. Request: http://www.yourdomain/user/full-detail
    2. Process: index.php hits "fullDetailMethod" method of User.php controller
    3. Content: Template.php reads "User\fullDetail.html" under "View"
    4. Response send back
     
    # Example (Error)
    1. Request: http://www.yourdomain/league/non-existing
    2. Error gets triggered as:
    404
    Method cannot be found: [Controller\league:nonExistingMethod]

# Install composer on system
$ curl -sSk https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --disable-tls
All settings correct for using Composer
Downloading 1.2.1...
 
Composer successfully installed to: /vagrant/composer.phar
Use it: php composer.phar
You have instructed the Installer not to enforce SSL/TLS security on remote HTTPS requests.
This will leave all downloads during installation vulnerable to Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks
 
# Globally enable composer
$ mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
$ composer self-update
You are already using composer version 1.2.1 (stable channel).
 
# Generate composer autoloader for the application
mvc $ composer dump-autoload -o
