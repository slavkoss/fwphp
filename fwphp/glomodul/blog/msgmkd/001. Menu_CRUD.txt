<p>
M-C-V data flow - controller instantiates M (and V if V is class) and pushes M data to V.
I do not see advantages compared to M-V data flow. Disadvantage are : for pagination M-V data flow is only possible solution, C is fat in large modules (lot of code). C in my msg (blog) module has lot of code, but code is very simple.

1, 2 and 3 are routing code snippets (odsjeƒçci) or separate scripts or separate classes.
