    eg working on HTML file along with its CSS counter-part. Right click on file tab and choose "Move to other view".  
    To split it vertically or horizontally right click dividing line between the to and choose rotate right or left.

Adding/Removing bookmarks  
You can toggle a bookmark on a single line by clicking on the bookmark margin in front of the line,  
or by selecting Search->Toggle Bookmark. The Search->Reverse Bookmarks command toggles  
bookmarks on each line of the currently opened document.  
To remove all bookmarks  
Select Search->Clear all Bookmarks.  
Navigating with bookmarks:  
F2 - To Jump with the cursor to the next line containing a bookmark, select Search->Next Bookmark,  
shift + F2 - to go to the previous bookmarked line select Search->Previous Bookmark.  
Modifying bookmarked lines:  
You can perform a single operation on all bookmarked lines.  
To cut each bookmarked line, select Search->Cut Bookmarked Lines. Every line will be cut  
from the file and added to the clipboard, so they can all be pasted at once.  
To copy, select Search->Copy bookmarked Lines instead.  
To replace each bookmarked line with the current clipboard contents, select Search->Paste to  
(Replace) bookmarked lines.  
To remove all bookmarked lines, select Search->Delete bookmarked lines.  
The Delete option allows you to search for lines first, mark them with a bookmark using search  
(see Search), then remove all of them based on a certain trait.  
  
Sessions  
are a set of files opened in Notepad++. They store the open files, the active file (and which view, see the  
section about Multi-View), the current selection and position in the file, the current bookmarks (see  
Bookmarks) and the current language (see the section about Languages). Using sessions, you can  
open a set of (related) files with one action.  
  
Multiple instances

Switching between documents  
Using tab bar. keyboard or mouse.  
Ctrl + Tab = next document  
shift + Ctrl + Tab = previous document.  
Mouse: right mouse button and scroll wheel scrolling up = previous document, scrolling down the next.  
The order of the documents is derived from the tab bar. See Tab Bar or Windows Dialog for information  
on how to change it.  
Documents will by default be cyclically selected, meaning that if you select the document past the last  
one,  
the first will be selected. If two views are visible, the first document of the other view will be selected.  
Selecting the document previous to the first document will select the last document (if two views are  
visible  
that will be the last document of the other view).  
The document switcher is a small list of currently opened files that is shown (if enabled, see  
Preferences)  
when you switch documents, allows you to select what document to activate before actually doing so.  
The list will remain visible until either you release the modifier key that triggered the list (Ctrl key if using  
the  
TAB key or the right mouse button if using the scroll wheel) or one of the documents has been selected  
by  
clicking on it with the left mouse button. The highlighted document will then be activated.  
Please note that if you assign anything else than Ctrl-(Shift-)TAB to switching documents, the  
document switcher will not work properly when switching using the keyboard. In that case, use the  
mouse or disable it (v5.4.3).  
Notepad++ can provide MRU behavior for switching between files. MRU stands for Most Recently  
Used and means that the first file to be activated, is the last one active before the current document.  
This will put often used files to the top and less used files to the bottom (If you are familiar with the  
Windows Task Switcher, the behavior is similar). MRU is only available when the Document Switcher is  
enabled.

F12 ? the tab bar disappears and the text ca be displayed on the full monitor height.  
Combined with View->Always on Top - to make text as easy and flexibly visible as one could wish.  
To enable line wrapping, select View->Wrap or press . icon.View->Show Symbol->Show wrap symbol.  
Display of where a line could wrap because its length exceeds some threshold can be enabled and  

configured in both Preferences and Styler Configurator. When choosing to just have a line break, you  
can control whether and where a wrap symbol is displayed.  
To zoom in, ctrl + + or Ctrl + scroll mousewheel or select View->Zoom->Zoom in or press the button.  
Folding  
Certain lines of your text can be hidden based on certain traits. Blocks of texts are 'parented' to others  
and by folding them (also called collapsing) only the first line is visible.  
You can recognize text that can be folded by looking at the fold margin on the left - shows icons and  
line to indicate the structure of the text (the appearance of the margin can be changed, see Styler  
Configurator and Preferences). The current lexer determines the structure (see Languages). Folded text  
is additionally indicated with a horizontal line where the text is collapsed. Lines on the fold margin  
indicate that the textlines they run by are foldable. Vertical lines ( ) indicate multiple lines that can be  
folded together as a group, which is terminated with a small horizontal - or a box.  
Also, you may decide to hide the margin completely, even when the language of the document allows  
for folding.  
There are multiple ways to fold text:  
The foremost means is by clicking with the left mouse button on a box with a minus sign.  
The same procedure but with the Ctrl key pressed down will cause the group to collapse, but also  
any sub groups inside - if you were to unfold just that group, all subgroups would still be folded.  
Using the menu:  
View->Fold All will fold every single group in the document, causing the minimal amount of text  
visible.  
View->Collapse current level will only collapse the current group (that is, the group that contains  
the current line, anywhere in the group). This will not collapse any subgroups.  
View->Collapse level... will collapse the selected level (ranging from 1 to 8). This will collapse all  
the groups on a particular level, but not any subgroups. You can use this to view your text  
with a certain 'level of detail'.  
To unfold folded text, use any of the following measures:  
Click on the box with the plus sign in the fold margin, this will expand that group.  
Shift or Ctrl Click on the box with the plus sign. This will expand the group and folded subgroups.  
Using the menu:  
View->Unfold All will expand every group in the document - maximum amount of text to be visible.  
View->Uncollapse current level will expand the current group (group that contains current line).  
This will not collapse any subgroups.  
View->Uncollapse level... - make every group of a certain level visible, including parenting group.  
Also note that if any change occurs in folded text, it will automatically unfold to show the text.  
Hiding lines  
Select the lines to hide (all but the very first or last line) and select View->Hide lines. The selected lines  
will be hidden and in the bookmark margin two icons will appear (> indicating the start and < indicating  
the end of the hidden section). Clicking on any of these two icons will show the lines again.  
Multi View  
You can enable a secondary edit window to be able to view two documents at the same time. If used  
with the same document, you can quickly compare two documents or make quick changes in two

places at the same time without having to scroll or keep bookmarks.  
To use Multi View, first activate the document. Then, you have two options:  
Select View->Move/Clone current document->Go to another view, this will move the document to the  
other view, closing it in the first view.  
Select View->Move/Clone current document->Clone to another view, this will clone the document into  
the other view, linking the two. Any change in the first document will automatically be forwarded to the  
second and vice versa. You can also reach these command by right-clicking on the tab of a document  
and selecting the command from the context menu.  
Note that these options are also available by dragging a tab into an edit field, with the Ctrl depressed  
for cloning and not depressed for moving  
Once you have Multi View enabled, you can control its layout. You can drag the divider around using  
your mouse, or click on the small arrows on the top and bottom to completely move it to the left or right.  
Rightclicking on the divider shows a popup menu allowing you to rotate the layout for a horizontal or  
vertical version.  
Although you can view two documents at the same time, only one can be active (have the focus). You  
can determine the active view by the tabbar if you have the topline enabled (see Tab bar). By default,  
the active view has a darker color of orange than the inactive view. Also, only the active view can have  
the caret. You can switch the active view by selecting View->Focus on other view. The active view  
determines what options are available from the menu or toolbar. If the main view has all documents  
saved, but the secondary view has modified tabs, you can only select the Save option if the secondary  
view is active.  
If you have the same document open in two views, they will share some properties, but some of them  
can be modified independently. These include:  
\* Folding (but not line hiding).  
\* Zoom level;  
\* Scroll position;  
\* Cursor position;  
\* RTL modus (see RTL)  
\* Line wrap modus  
\* Overtype mode  
\* Nonprintable characters rendering  
If you open a new document or a file, it will do so in the currently active view. Additionally, closing the  
last document of a view will close that view if two views are visible (including moving the last document  
of one view to the other).  
To ease document comparison/navigation, you can enable scroll locking in Multi View. When a lock is  
enabled, scrolling one view will automatically scroll the other. The lock will attempt to keep the current  
offset. This means if one view is scrolled 5 lines lower than the other, the vertical scroll lock will keep  
this distance unless this is not possible anymore. Is soon as it is possible it will retain the offset again.  
To enable horizontal scroll locking, select View->Synchronize Horizontal Scrolling or press the button.  
To enable vertical scroll locking, select View->Synchronize Vertical Scrolling or press the button.

How to select text  
When using the mouse, the most basic way - but there are other - is to drag the mouse from start point  
to end point. You can also double click a word to select it, or triple click on a line to select it. The same  
effect is achieved by a simple click on the line number margin. You can extend a selection by shift  
clicking its new insertion point.  
When using the keyboard, the expected procedure is to use navigation keys in conjunction with the  
Shift modifier. These keyboard shortcuts can be changed at any time using the Shortcut Mapper.  
Stream vs rectangular selection  
The above procedures are known to define a stream selection, which encompasses a contiguous range  
of text. Using the SCI_SWAPMAINANCHORCARET Scintilla command from the Shortcut mapper, you  
can choose whether the caret starts or ends the selection.  
However, Notepad++ also knows about rectangular selections, which define a rectangle of strips on  
contiguous lines.  
To select a rectangle, use the above methods while also holding the Alt modifier key down. For exmple,  
the basic way with the mouse is to Alt-click the start point and Alt-move the mouse to the end point, and  
so forth. The Alt- versions of keyboard shortcuts can be changed as well.  
It is possible to combine a stream selection and arectangular selection, using the keyboard. This is  
probably less useful, but is not a bug.  
The Edit -> Line operations -> Move Up/Down current line commands also move the selected area, if it  
is not rectangular. This ability is lost when several selections are made - see below.  
Multiple stream selections  
If a stream area is selected, it is possible to add another, disjoint area by Ctrl-clicking its start point and  
moving the mouse to the end point. More than one extra selection can be added this way. (Multi-Editing  
should be enabled in Preferences)  
However, this ability does not extend to rectangular selections. A rectangular selection may still cling to  
one of the stream selections though. The SCI_ROTATESELECTION Scintilla command enables to cycle  
through selections, in the order they were defined.  
When copying or cutting a multiple selection, the text is recorded in the order the selections appear,  
regardless of the order in which they were made.

Macros  
Notepad++ is capable of recording some of your actions you perform while editing a document, and  
replaying those later on to avoid having to repeat that sequence of actions. This is called a macro and  
can save a great deal of time. Macro's can be played once, or multiple times, even as long as is  
required to run through an entire document. You can save them for later use and assign keystrokes to  
them for fast access (See Shortcut Mapper). Macro's are sensitive to the current position of the cursor  
and will (normally speaking) operate relative on it.  
To record a macro, select Macro->Start Recording or press the button on the toolbar. Notepad++ will  
now keep track of the changes you make on a document or certain actions you perform.  
To stop recording, select Macro->Stop Recording or select the button on the toolbar. As an exception  
to most commands, you can toggle this behavior with a special shortcut combination that is not listed in  
the menu but solely in the Shortcut mapper (see Settings, Shortcutmapper). By default, this is the  
combination Ctrl-Shift-R.  
After the recording is stopped, it will be stored in a temporary buffer. If you haven't performed any  
actions, this buffer will be cleared. If you start recording another macro without saving your earlier work,  
it will be lost.  
To play the macro in the buffer, select Macro->Playback or press the button. This will perform the  
macro once at the current position.  
To save the macro in the buffer, select Macro->Save current recorded macro or press the button. A  
dialog will pop up asking for a name of the macro and the default key combination. These can later be  
changed (and deleted) using the Shortcutmapper (see Shortcut Mapper). When saved, the macro will  
be available from the Macro menu or the Macro playlist.  
To play the current macro in the buffer or any saved macro once or multiple times, select Macro->Run  
a macro multiple times... or press the button. A dialog will pop up allowing you to select what macro to  
perform (buffer macro or any saved macro) and how many times. You can also opt to perform the macro  
until the cursor reaches the end of the current file (starting from its current position). Note that if no  
macro's are available, this dialog is inaccessible.  
To edit or delete an existing macro shortcut, you can use the Shortcut mapper, which displays all  
shortcuts of all kinds, and allows changing or removing a key binding. The interface is also available  
through the Macro -> Modify shortcut / Delete macro entry on the Macros menu. Note that the contents  
of a macro definition can be edited only in the shortcuts.xml file.

To run a new command  
Sselect Run->Run.... A dialog will pop up asking for the path to the program and possible any  
command line parameters. You can use the browse button to search for your program. The drop down  
list provides recently run programs. The command line arguments can also be based on the status of  
the current document, and are always enclosed in $(...), where … can be:  
FULL\_CURRENT\_PATH  
the fully qualified path to the current document.  
CURRENT_DIRECTORY  
The directory the current document resides in.  
FILE_NAME  
The filename of the document, without the directory.  
NAME_PART  
The filename without the extension.  
EXT_PART  
The extension of the current document.  
NPP_DIRECTORY  
The directory that contains the notepad++.exe executable that is currently running.  
>CURRENT_WORD  
The currently selected text in the document.  
CURRENT_LINE  
The current line number that is selected in the document (0 based index, the first line is 0).  
CURRENT_COLUMN  
The current column the cursor resides in (0 based index, the first position on the line is 0).  
For example  
"$(NPP\_DIRECTORY)\\notepad++.exe" -multiInst "$(FULL\_CURRENT_PATH)"  
would start a new instance of Notepad++ opening the current file. Remember to put quotes around  
paths if it can contain spaces. For the Notepad++ command line options, see Command Line.  
To run an existing command:  
Select it from the Run menu below the Run... option. If no commands are saved, the list will be empty.  
To save the command:  
Sselect Run->Run..., enter the command and press Save.... A dialog will pop up asking for a name of  
the command and the default key combination. Once saved, the command will be available from the  
Run menu.  
To edit or delete an existing command:  
The Shortcut Mapper (see Shortcut Mapper) displays all available commands in a uniform way, so you  
can modify or delete any shortcut you defined, including Run commands. This procedure is also  
available from Run -> Modify shortcut / Delete command. As the name suggests, this does not extend  
to editing the command text proper - you need to edit shortcuts.xml to do that.  
  
Command Line  
Notepad++ supports a few command line parameters to control its startup. The following options are  
supported (they are case sensitive):  
-nline number

Line number to go to for each file opened.  
-c  
Start editing in Column mode.  
--help  
Displays this list, i.e. all the command line switches  
-loadingTime  
Displays the loading time of all files Notepad++ is started with. The result is displayed in a  
message box, with a 0.01 second resolution.  
-multiInst  
allow Notpead++ to start more than one instance. By default, if Notepad++ is already started files  
wil lbe opened in that instance, but this option will start a new one.  
-noPlugin  
Do not load any plugins. If you suspect a defunct plugin or you just do not wish to load them, add  
this option.  
-ro  
Any file now opened will be opened in Read only mode.  
-nosession  
Do not load the previous session if Notepad++ is started. Do not save the session on exit either.  
-notabbar  
Hide the Tab Bar, even if the settings say otherwise.  
-systemtray  
Start Notepad++ minimised in the system tray, aka notification area  
-xline number  
Specify the horizontal position (in pixels) at which Notepad++ main window is to open.  
-yline number  
Specify the vertical position (in pixels) at which Notepad++ main window is to open.  
-llanguage short name  
Language to set for each file opened. $$$ is a short identifier string, of which the following are  
allowed:  
Normal, php, c, cpp, cs, objc, d, java, rc, html, xml, makefile, pascal, batch, ini, nfo, asp, sql, vb,  
javascript, css, perl, python, lua, tex, cobol, fortran, bash, actionscript, nsis, tcl, lisp, scheme,  
asm, diff, props, postscript, ruby, smalltalk, vhdl, kix, autoit, Gui4Cli, powershell, caml, ada,  
verilog, matlab, haskell, inno, cmake, yaml,r, jsp  
Files  
Anything else will be interpreted as a filename. Always quote your filename to allow the path to  
contain spaces, otherwise Notepad++ will split the single path into multiple paths at each space.  
The order of the options is not important.  
For compatibility, Notepad++ will first try to identify the entire command line as a filename, even if it is  
unquoted. It is however not recommended to do this, always quote the filename.  
Control files  
The startup behavior of Notepad++ can be adjusted with a few (0 sized) control files. Their absence or  
presence will control how Notepad++ acts:  
doLocalConf.xml  
If present, Notepad++ will use the installation directory for all configurations. If abscent,  
%APPDATA% is used instead.  
asNotepad.xml  
If present, Notepad++ will act as Windows Notepad, meaning it will launch in multiple instances,  
hides the tab bar and will not load the previous session.

Shell Extension  
By default the Notepad++ installer comes with a Shell extension. This is not really part of the  
Notepad++ program but very useful. If you choose to install it, then any file you rightclick on will show  
an entry named "Edit with Notepad++" with the Notepad++ icon.  
Please note that to install or remove the extension, it sometimes is required to restart the Explorer  
process. For this you can reboot, logout and log back in or use the task manager to kill explorer  
(Windows NT and up) and restart it again. You can do this by hitting Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Del.  
If the Shell extension is already installed, the Notepad++ installer cannot update or overwrite it, you first  
have to uninstall it and restart Explorer.  
If you issue the install command for the dll, which is regsvr32 /i NppShell_01.dll, a dialog box  
will pop up from which various details of the behaviour of the extension can be tweaked. The trailing  
number will increase as versions go.

n++ Plugins  

-----------------

[http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/notepad-plus/index.php?title=Plugin_Central](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/notepad-plus/index.php?title=Plugin_Central)  
Download: Notepad++ Plugins project: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/) or anywhere on inet  
Plugin **Plugin Manager** works out the installation details and version management for you.

Notepad++ comes bundled with a few plugins (when using the installer, you can choose which ones to add.  
Plugins are located in Plugins subdir in main installation directory.  
They are DLL files and removing or adding them is enough.  
When Notepad++ starts, it looks into its Plugins configuration folder and **loads whatever dll it finds**.  
Later, you can add plugins using the Settings -> Import -> Import plugins menu.  

If a plugin misbehaves, Notepad++ will go out of its way to prevent the failure from propagating so as to  
avoid any loss of data. In such a case, you will be presented with information about the plugin reporting  
a problem. Making this information available on the Plugin Development forum will help removing the  
cause of the problem as soon as possible.

Facility that provides an IDE like **Dreamweaver, Coda or Aptana Studio** should install many plugins -we can conclude that Notepad++ is not a good choice for developing web sites, at least for people who are learning

Latest update: - You can now add a new snippet to a library  
based upon the current selection  
or based upon the content of the clipboard.  
Right-click the snippets list to use these items.  
\- Installation has been improved. A template database is provided  
and when the plug-in tries to find an existing database  
and it can't find it, it copies this template database to the  
AppData plugin-config directory.  
\- The About dialog now shows the change-log.  
\- When you upgrade the very first time the change-log  
for the current version will be shown.

the automatic selection of the library is improved.  
The first language specific library is preferred over the  
first general library.  
\- Resized the edit snippet dialog.  
\- Upgrade to SQLite version 3.7.9

WebEdit  
=============================  
another attempt to integrate a user-configurable code template  
collection into Notepad++. With WebEdit you have the following options:  
\* create a menu command for pasting some text, possibly surrounding  
the current selection, if any. Up to 30 such commands can be created  
and optionally assigned keyboard shortcuts and/or toolbar buttons.  
\* you can create a set of "tags" or abbreviations. Type one of them,  
then press Alt+Enter and it will be replaced with the corresponding  
block of text. The caret will be placed in a predefined position  
within the new text.  
You can even have the current clipboard contents pasted as part  
of the tag replacement operation.

The plugin configuration is stored in the WebEdit.ini file.  
Use "WebEdit\\Edit Config" command from the "Plugins" menu to open  
the file in Notepad++ for editing.

All keyboard shortcuts can be assigned/modified using the standard  
Shortcut Mapper.

\- Fixed: "  
" now indents by copying only the leading whitespace of the first line,  
not the whole part up to the tag.  
\- Fixed invalid caret placement after replacing a tag when you move  
the caret with up and down keys (it used to jump to a different  
column, probably due to a Scintilla bug).  

SnippetPlus  
=============================
