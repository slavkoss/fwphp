## DDNS (Dynamic DNS)

After completing 3 steps in NOTE below :

1.URL from LAN (intranet) - shows web server's document root
2.URL from inet
where : http://localtest.me:8083/ is free (non commercial) wildcarded DNS Domain which always resolve back to 127.0.0.1 (your local machine)

DDNS : 3 steps for dynamic IP

    Find your inet provider's nonstatic public IP adress eg 213.191.136.167 eg here: https://www.yougetsignal.com/

    Register (sign up) eg here: https://freedns.afraid.org/ for free or payed DDNS account

    Send your public IP adress eg 213.191.136.167 to DDNS provider so :
    https://freedns.afraid.org/nic/update?hostname=phporacle.mooo.com&myip=213.191.136.167
    (asks user name and password aquired in register step)

**Use the correct DocType Definition (DTD)**

Especially in Internet Explorer, you MUST use a standards compliant !DOCTYPE, and for Internet Explorer this MUST be the first line of your (x)html. Using <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> will switch IE into quirks mode.

A list of the recommended DTDs can be found at the following link:  Recommended DTDs to use in your Web document.

 
What it's all about (WHY)
w3c.org website says :

    "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a mechanism for adding style (e.g. fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents."

It is so much more. Bootstrap with jQuery is big (>200kB) and slow. This page does not use them.

 
I say :

    "Routing in PHP (menus, framework -  linking mosaic pieces - code snippets) is in all learning sources I found :
              insufficent / to complicated coding / bad explained.
    Some of them have excellent ideas and code."
